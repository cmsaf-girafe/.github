A place for the GIRAFE community to discuss, learn and collaborate.

Global Interpolated RainFall Estimation (GIRAFE) is a method for deriving
precipitation from satellites by 
[Roca et al (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-24568-9_24). 

The corresponding climate data record is
[GIRAFE-v1](https://doi.org/10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/GIRAFE/V001),
generated by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Climate
Monitoring (CM SAF).
